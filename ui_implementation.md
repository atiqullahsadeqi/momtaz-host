1. Project Context

Product: Momtaz Host ‚Äî Hosting & Web Services
Goal: Professional marketing website + scalable structure (future client area) similar to Hostinger.
Stack: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (latest, via MCP), Framer Motion (subtle animation).
Brand: Tech-forward, trustworthy, performant. Primary theme managed via globals.css.

Guiding Rules

Use shadcn/ui components first. Only fallback to raw Tailwind if no suitable component exists.

Reference demo components before adding new ones (ensures correct usage).

Accessibility-first (semantic HTML, aria labels, focus states).

Responsive-first (mobile ‚Üí desktop).

Consistent spacing, typography, states across sections.

Always update PROJECT_STATUS.md after completing new UI parts.

2. Global Design System
   2.1 Theme & Tokens

All colors and surfaces are handled through shadcn theme variables in globals.css.

Primary: bg-primary, text-primary-foreground

Secondary: bg-secondary, text-secondary-foreground

Foreground: text-foreground

Muted Foreground: text-muted-foreground

Background: bg-background, text-foreground

Card: bg-card, text-card-foreground

Border: border-border

Destructive (errors): bg-destructive, text-destructive-foreground

This ensures the entire site can be rebranded simply by changing variables in globals.css.

2.2 Typography

Headings: bold, high-impact, use text-foreground for maximum contrast.

Body: normal weight, text-muted-foreground for secondary copy.

Max line length: ~65‚Äì75ch for readability.

2.3 Layout & Spacing

App shell: Header (sticky), Main, Footer.

Responsive container widths via Tailwind container utilities.

Vertical rhythm: py-16‚Äìpy-24 between sections.

Rounded corners: use shadcn defaults (rounded-lg / rounded-xl).

Shadows: subtle elevation on CTAs/pricing cards.

3. Component Library (shadcn-first)
