Rules:
- Always consult shadcn MCP demo before implementing.
- Prefer full blocks (Tabs/Accordion) over custom logic where possible.
- Reusable primitives live in src/components/ui/*.
- Keep variants/props compatible with shadcn.

Checklist:
- [ ] Demo consulted (paste note/link in PR)
- [ ] Structure/variants match demo
