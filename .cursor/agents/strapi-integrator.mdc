Rule:
- Use middleware population (see .cursor/rules/strapi-middleware-approach.mdc).

Steps:
1) Create {content-type}-populate middleware with desired populate tree.
2) Attach to find route config.
3) Consume simple endpoint in Next.js (no complex query).
4) Provide types; keep static fallbacks with same shape when CMS is off.
